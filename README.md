# react-articles-mirage

Welcome to the documentation for the `react-articles-mirage` repository.

## Overview

This project is a React application that serves as a prototype to demonstrate how articles will work in a larger system. The prototype is also used to test a new library called MirageJs which is used to simulate an API for development and testing purposes. The app is built using Vite, a build tool that provides a faster and more streamlined development experience.

## Installation

To run the application locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using Git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MeReda/react-articles-mirage.git
```

2. Navigate into the repository directory:

```bash
cd react-articles-mirage
```

3. Install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

4. Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The application should now be running at `http://localhost:5173`.

## Usage

The application is a simple prototype that allows users to view articles and their details. The articles are retrieved from the MirageJs API, which is a simulated API for development and testing purposes. You can modify the articles by editing the MirageJs configuration file `src/server.js`.

To view the articles in the application, simply navigate to `http://localhost:5173`. You can view the details of an article by clicking on it in the list of articles.
